# Expectations:
# - Config-first, artifact-first, deterministic-by-default.
# - Spark for heavy scans/aggregations/compression; Python for orchestration/UX.
# - Type hints on all public functions; Google-style docstrings.
# - Structured audit logging for config changes and overrides.
# - No hardcoded values; use config with defaults.
# - Prefer apply_patch for single-file edits.
# - Do not create more than 5 markdown files.
# - Create Sphinx documentation once the package is ready; keep docstrings comprehensive in code.
# - Do not use emoji or any icons in code; maintain professional tone.
